1940.
On my birthday
The Germans walked-walked into Holland
Germans invaded Hungary
I was in 2nd grade
I had a teacher
A very tall man, his head was completely plastered smooth
He said, "Black Crows-
Black Crows invaded our country many years ago"
And he pointed right at me
No more school
You must go away
And she said, "Quick, go!"
And he said, "Don't breathe"
Into the cattle wagons
And for four days and four nights
And then we went through these strange sounding names
Polish-Polish names
Lots of cattle wagons there
They were loaded with people
They shaved us
They tattooed a number on our arm
Flames going up in the sky
It was smokey
